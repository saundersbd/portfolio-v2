        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <p>
          Right now I am a Product Design Lead at{" "}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paylocity.com">
            Paylocity
          </a>
          , where I am leading a team defining the future of the mobile
          application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before Paylocity I worked at an agency called{" "}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vokal.io">
            Vokal
          </a>{" "}
          where I designed cross-platform experiences, and created design
          systems to support them. Before that I worked at{" "}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maddockdouglas.com">
            Maddock Douglas
          </a>
          , an innovation firm in the Chicago suburbs. At MD I used my
          prototyping skills to help our clients see future opportunities for
          growth.

        <h2>What sets me apart</h2>

        <h3>Front end knowledge</h3>

        <p>
          The best thing I ever did for myself was take the time to learn HTML
          and CSS. We were designing our first websites in school and were
          supposed to use Dreamweaver to build them. I knew that wasn't how real
          websites should be made, so I spent an afternoon at the library
          teaching myself how to do it the right way. I learned HTML and CSS,
          and those skills have led to every professional opportunity I've had
          since. After school I hacked together wordpress themes and started
          learning PHP, and eventually I began to teach myself Javascript. I've
          continued to expand my front end skills and I depend on them to
          communicate with engineers and prototype ideas every day. I built this
          website myself using React and{" "}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org">
            Next.js
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <h3>Design background</h3>

        <p>
          I went to school for traditional graphic design and my education was
          grounded in durable principles of good design, rather than software
          skills that would become outdated the second I left school. NIU taught
          me what good looks like, and how to think like a designer in any
          medium. Early in the program I only wanted to learn more tools, but
          I've come to realize that they got it right by leading with design
          fundamentals.
        </p>

        <h3>Passion for writing</h3>

        <p>
          Writing is how I clarify my thinking. A lot of times I'll sit down to
          write something and realize that I don't know how to say what's on my
          mind. That's the testâ€”if I can write about it clearly, that means I
          understand it.
