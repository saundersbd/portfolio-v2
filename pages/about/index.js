            <p>
              Right now I am a Senior Product Designer at{" "}

              . Community helps teams collaborate and stay aligned at work.
              Other product areas I've worked in at Paylocity include payroll,
              HR, and analytics.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before Paylocity I worked at an agency called{" "}
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vokal.io">
                Vokal
              </a>{" "}
              where I designed cross-platform experiences, and created design
              systems to support them. Before that I worked at{" "}
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maddockdouglas.com">
                Maddock Douglas
              </a>
              , an innovation firm in the Chicago suburbs. At MD I used my
              prototyping skills to help our clients see future opportunities
              for growth.

            <h2>What sets me apart</h2>

            <h3>Front end knowledge</h3>

            <p>
              The best thing I ever did for myself was take the time to learn
              HTML and CSS. We were designing our first websites in school and
              were supposed to use Dreamweaver to build them. I knew that wasn't
              how real websites were made, so I spent an afternoon at the
              library teaching myself how to do it the right way. I learned HTML
              and CSS, and those skills have led to every professional
              opportunity I've had since. After school I hacked together
              wordpress themes and started learning more PHP, and eventually I
              slowly began to teach myself Javascript too. I've continued to
              expand my front end skills and I depend on them to communicate
              with engineers and prototype ideas every day. I built this website
              myself using React and{" "}
              <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org">
                Next.js
              </a>
              .
            </p>

            <h3>Design background</h3>

            <p>
              I went to school for traditional graphic design and my education
              was grounded in durable principles of good design, rather than
              software skills that would become outdated the second I left
              school. NIU taught me what good looks like, and how to think like
              a designer in any medium. Early in the program I only wanted to
              learn more tools, but I've come to realize that they got it right
              by leading with design fundamentals.
            </p>

            <h3>Passion for writing</h3>

            <p>
              Writing is how I clarify my thinking. A lot of times I'll sit down
              to write something and realize that I don't know how to say what's
              on my mind. That's the testâ€”if I can write about it clearly, that
              means I understand it.
            </p>
