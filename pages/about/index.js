            For as long as I can remember I've enjoyed solving puzzles and
            figuring things out. I get to do those things every day when I'm
            designing software and I'm thankful to have found a career that lets
            me practice what I enjoy and am good at.

          <h2>Experience</h2>

          <p>
            I'm a designer living and working in Chicago. I have over 10 years
            of experience designing software. In that time I've worked at many
            levels of scale, from small mobile apps to enterprise software used
            by millions of people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Right now I am a Senior Product Designer at Paylocity, were I work
            on a product called Community. Community helps teams collaborate and
            stay aligned at work. Other areas I've worked in at Paylocity
            include payroll, HR, and analytics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before Paylocity I worked at an agency called Vokal where I designed
            cross-platform experiences, and created design systems to support
            them. Before that I worked at Maddock Douglas, an innovation firm in
            the Chicago suburbs. At MD I used my prototyping skills to help our
            clients see future opportunities for growth.
          </p>

          <h2>What sets me apart</h2>

          <h3>Front end knowledge</h3>

          <p>
            The best thing I ever did for myself was take the time to learn HTML
            and CSS. We were designing architect websites in school and had to
            use Dreamweaver to build our website. I knew that wasn't how real
            websites were made, so I spent an afternoon at the library teaching
            myself how to do it the right way. I taught myself HTML and CSS, and
            those skills have led to every professional opportunity I've had
            since. Today I've expanded my front end skills I depend on them to
            communicate with engineers and prototype ideas.
          </p>

          <h3>Formal design background</h3>

          <p>
            I went to school for traditional graphic design and therefore my
            education was based on durable principles of good design, rather
            than software skills that would become outdated the second I left
            school. NIU taught me what good looks like, and how to think like a
            designer across any medium. Early on in the program I only wanted to
            learn more software tools, but I've come to realize that they got it
            right by leading with principles.
          </p>

          <h3>Passion for writing</h3>

          <p>
            Writing is how I clarify my thinking. A lot of times I'll sit down
            to write documentation and realize that I don't know how to say
            what's on my mind. And I realize that if I can't write clearly about
            something it's a sign I'm not thinking about it clearly. For me
            writing is a test of sortsâ€”if I can write about it, that means I
            understand it.
