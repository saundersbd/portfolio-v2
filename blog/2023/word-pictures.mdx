  "When you sketch too early, premature decisions get encoded into the sketch

In a section of his book **The Nature of Order: The Process of Creating Life**,
Christopher Alexander wrote about the early stages of the design process. He was
mainly concerned with design processes that are governed by a "living process"
in the designer's mind. In talking about this process, Alexander suggests an
interesting first step: creating a "word picture."

The idea of starting with a word picture is a reaction to how architects (and
designers) typically start the design process. Alexander says that it's the
first steps in a design process that count for the most, because the first few
steps create the initial form and carry within them the destiny for the rest of
whatever is being designed. In the early stages of the process, designers should
concentrate on the broad structure of the whole. Designers often capture these
first steps in a simple sketch or computer representation. The problem with
this, Alexander says, is that the sketch always includes too much information,
too early in the process, to the extent that it is inevitably over-specific. It
contains too much arbitrary information, and lots of decisions that have come
too early.

The word picture comes into this because Alexander suggests that what we need is
a way to represent emerging form that stays closer to what we actually know at
each moment. This method should focus only on the most global features of the
emerging design, without encoding too many early decisions into the output.

Simply put, a word picture spells out, **in words**, what the design is like. If
you're designing a product, what is it like to discover it and to use it? Use
words to illustrate a vision of the finished product, as beautiful as you can
make it. Alexander's examples are from architecture. Words are a medium that can
describe all the essential features of a building without being ultra-specific
about the design of it too early in the process:

> volume, articulation..."

That example perfectly summarizes the value of starting with words. I find that
in the earliest stages of the product design process, being too concrete too
soon causes forces me into stakeholders conversations that are too in the weeds,
and also puts me on a specific path before some more appealing possibilities
have had a chance to emerge. Early on, it's best to focus on alignment about
what the product or feature should be like and, as Alexander suggests, let
things unfold through a living process so exploration isn't cut off prematurely.
