      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        My whole life has been defined by a sense of curiosity and an excitement
        about learning new things. I came by a lot of my curiosity naturally as
        a side effect of growing up with teachers for parents. My parents
        encouraged me to read and took me and my sister on lots of educational
        vacations, and that sparked a lifelong interest in history. Music was
        also important in our house growing up, and music education is a
        tradition that goes back for generations on both sides of the family.

        I&rsquo;m a designer who is always experimenting with new tools and
        reading so I can become a more well-rounded thinker. Design is a
        learning professionâ€”if you don&rsquo;t absolutely love to learn new
        things you can&rsquo;t be successful in the long run. It brings me a lot
        of joy to learn something new and share it with others.

      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <p>
        Right now I&rsquo;m a Principal Product Designer at{" "}
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.paylocity.com">
          Paylocity
        </a>
        , where I&rsquo;m leading the design for the company&rsquo;s new native
        mobile apps as we transition away from a hybrid app.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Paylocity I worked at an agency called{" "}
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.vokal.io">
          Vokal
        </a>{" "}
        where I created cross-platform experiences, and the design systems
        required to support them. Before that I worked at Maddock Douglas, an
        innovation firm in the Chicago suburbs. At MD I used my prototyping
        skills to help our clients see future opportunities for growth.

      <h2>My background</h2>

      <h4>Front-end knowledge</h4>

      <p>
        The best thing I ever did for myself was take the time to learn HTML and
        CSS. We were designing our first websites in school and were supposed to
        use Dreamweaver to build them. I knew that wasn&rsquo;t the proper way
        to make a website, so rather than learn Dreamweaver I learned how to
        write HTML and CSS. After school I taught myself PHP by hacking together
        Wordpress themes, and eventually I taught learned Javascript. These
        skills have led to every professional opportunity I&rsquo;ve ever had.
        I&rsquo;ve continued to expand my front end skills and depend on them to
        communicate with engineering teams and prototype ideas every day. I
        built this website using React and{" "}
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org">
          Next.js
        </a>
        .
      </p>

      <h4>Design education</h4>

      <p>
        I went to school for traditional graphic design. My education was
        grounded in durable principles of good design, rather than software
        skills that would become outdated the second I left school. NIU taught
        me what good looks like, and how to think like a designer in any medium.
        Early in the program I only wanted to learn about more design tools, but
        I&rsquo;ve realized that they got it right by leading with design
        fundamentals.
      </p>

      <h4>Passion for writing</h4>

      <p>
        Writing is a sort of test for me. If I find that I can write about
        something clearly, that usually means I understand it. I know I have a
        long way to go on my writing journey, but I&rsquo;m passionate about it
        and enjoy the process.
