title: "The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to Power"
author: "Robert Caro"
description:
  "I'd heard about how good Caro was for a long time but his work is
  intimidating. At first the subject matter seems dry—how could anyone do
  five  books on Lyndon Johnson, and who would want to read that? All I can say
  is that this book set a new standard for me, and every bit of history or
  biography I've read since has paled in comparison."

To call this book a biography would be underselling it. It's a portrait of not
just the early life of a major historical figure, but of what it was like to
come of age in America in that specific time and place. The thing is, the book's
long, and it's only part one of an eventual five-part series. And it's not even
the longest book in the series. The good news is that Caro can really write and
I was captivated the whole way through. It's much easier to read history when
the historian happens to be an outstanding author as well.

As I entered the final stretch of the book I could sense that it was ending soon
and began to mourn its loss. You can only experience a book like this for the
first time once.
