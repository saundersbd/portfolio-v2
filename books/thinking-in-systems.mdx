### Systems happen all at once

> Words and sentences must, by necessity, come only one at a time in linear,
> logical order. Systems happen all at once.

### Judge the results, not the rhetoric

> Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.

If you want to judge the effectiveness of a system, watch how people in the
system behave and pay attention to the results that the system actually
generates. The stated goals are not the system.

### Look for non-obvious ways to influence the system

#### The bathtub example

> Therefore, we sometimes miss seeing that we can fill a bathtub not only by
> increasing the inflow rate, but also by decreasing the outflow rate.

This is from an example of a basic system where there is a bathtub and you are
trying to control the level of water in the tub. If you want to raise the water
level it might seem more intuitive to adjust the tap to increase the water flow.
But it is easy to miss that an equally effective way to raise the water level
would be to adjust the stopper where the water lets out. I think about this all
the time and it reminds me to attack problems from angles that don't always seem
obvious. We tend to focus on in the inflows more than the outflows.

#### Stocks and delays

The level of the water in the bathtub is called a "stock" and it is interesting
to note that althought you can make changes to both the inflow (the tap) and the
outflow (the drain), the change in the water level happens slowly after you make
the change. So any time you make a change to a system you need to account for
the lag or delay that prevents you from observing the effects right away. Don't
give up too soon.

> Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the
> mechanisms for regulating the mechanisms in the stocks by manipulating flows.

### How to decide if you're looking at a system or just a bunch of stuff:

- Can you identify the parts?
- Do the parts affect each other?
- Do the parts together produce an effect that is different from the effect of
  each part on its own?
- Does the effect, the behavior over time, persist in a variety of
  circumstances?

### The self-perpetuating nature of systems

> An important function of almost every system is to ensure its own
> perpetuation.

Systems tend to consist of mechanisms designed to ensure the survival of the
system. Many times these mechanisms run contrary to the stated goals of the
system.
