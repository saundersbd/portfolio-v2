## Notes

### Supply-side vs. demand-side thinking

Traditional sales are not in sync with the way people buy, and we need to flip the focus from the supply side to the demand side:

<Blockquote>
  Supply-side: The focus is on the product or service and its features and
  benefits. How will I sell it? Who needs my product? You define demand through
  the product. In this scenario, the consumer is usually nebulous—an imagined,
  personified version of the customer—an aggregated set of demographic and
  psychographic information. You aggregate and triangulate the consumer around
  the product through correlative data. When operating under this model you
  canvas the world for people who need your product, adding features and
  benefits along the way, to reach the widest audience. With supply-side
  thinking the focus is on the profit—the product must make money inside a
  specific cost structure. Everything you talk about goes through the lens of
  the product or service. You push your product. The supply-side does not see
  how the product fits into people’s lives. It’s the fishbowl analogy: you
  cannot see the whole picture swimming on the inside, only what surrounds you.
</Blockquote>

<Blockquote>
  Demand-side: The focus is on understanding the buyer and the user. How do
  people buy and how do they make progress? What’s causing them to make a
  purchase? You design your go-to-market strategy around the buyer’s worldview,
  not the product. You are looking at the world through a real buyer’s eyes.
  It’s understanding value from the customer-side of the world, as opposed to
  the product-side of the world. Demand-side selling is understanding what
  progress people want to make, and what they are willing to pay to make that
  progress. Our product or services are merely part of their solution. You
  create pull for your product because you are focused on helping the customer.
  Demand-side selling starts with the struggling moment. It’s the theory that
  people buy when they have a struggling moment and think, “Maybe, I can do
  better.”
</Blockquote>

### Understand the demand _without_ your product or solution

<Blockquote>
  Supply-side and demand-side together make a business work. The key to synching
  these two world views starts with understanding demand without the product or
  your solution—just the context and desired outcomes, tradeoffs, and hiring
  requirements.
</Blockquote>

### On the importance of asking questions

<Blockquote>
  "Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the
  question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right
  off. You have to ask the question—you have to want to know—in order to open up
  the space for the answer to fit." –Clayton Christensen
</Blockquote>

### You can't design how your customer makes progress

<Blockquote>
  You cannot design the way your customer makes progress; you need to understand
  their definition of progress and design your process around it. People don’t
  buy products; they hire them to make progress in their lives.
</Blockquote>

### Push and pull dynamics

<Blockquote>
  The push of the situation and the magnetism of the new solution need to be
  stronger than their anxieties and habits before they will buy.
</Blockquote>

### Salespeople as helpers

<Blockquote>
  Unfortunately, most salespeople are not taught to think of themselves as a
  helper.
