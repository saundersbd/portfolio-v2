### Notes

What's amazing to me about Lincoln's writing is how easy it is to understand, even today. I used to assume that everything written in the 1800s just had the trait of being hard on the modern reader, but when you read Lincoln it's not like that. He took pride in simplifying his writing so that anyone could understand it. He kept his words and phrases mostly short—though he used long sentences to great effect also.

Source material is great for the reader who is really curious about history. In order to understand much of what Lincoln is talking about in his speech, you need to know the historical context, which means frequent detours to read about other happenings of the day. I love the feeling of not understanding a paragraph, and then doing a bit of research to find the larger context that illuminates its meaning.

### The book

This book breaks down one of Lincoln's most important, but least widely-read, speeches. Before he became president, Lincoln did a speaking tour in the east that eventually led him to New York City. Since he was relatively unknown there, and because his speech went off so well, it is generally acknowledged that the speech is responsible for his securing the Republican nomination for the presidency.

What Harold Holzer's book excelled at was giving the reader every bit of context that they might need to understand the speech. The line-by-line analysis of the speech took up a relatively small portion of the book, and the rest was devoted to understanding the political and social dynamics of the country at the time. By the time I got to the analysis portion I knew what I needed to know in order to understand the speech itself.

### A different time

The last thing I want to say about the book for now is that it is fun to imagine a time where an audience could listen to a 90-minute political speech, go bananas over it, and then demand to hear even more speeches before going home. The election of 1860 had 80% voter turnout—shocking by today's standards. It's inspiring to read about a time when the written and spoken word were so important and admired.
