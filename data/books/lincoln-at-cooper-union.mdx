# Lincoln at Cooper Union

By Harold Holzer

<p className="large">
  I've read a lot about Lincoln, but only recently did I start reviewing the
  transcripts of his actual speeches and writing. Going directly to the source
  has changed my understanding and increased my appreciation for Lincoln as an
  author and communicator.

## Notes

What's amazing to me about Lincoln's writing is how easy it is to read given the time period it was written in. Writing from the 1800s tends to have a lot of embroidery, and contain a lot of superfluous words and phrases that make the text difficult to parse. When you read Lincoln it's not like that. He took pride in simplifying his writing so that anyone could understand it. He kept his words and phrases mostly short—though he was not afraid of long sentences either and used them sparingly and to great effect.

The other thing about reading source material directly is that it's a real treat for someone who is curious about history. In order to understand much of what Lincoln is talking about you need to know a bit of the historical context of the era, so the footnotes give you threads to pull on for further research. I love the feeling of not understanding a paragraph, and then doing the necessary research to get the larger context that illuminates its meaning.

### The book

This book breaks down one of Lincoln's most important, but least widely-read, speeches. Before he became president, Lincoln toured the east to give a speech in New York City. Since he was relatively unknown in the east, and because his speech went off so well, it is generally acknowledged that this speech is responsible for him securing the Republican nomination for the presidency.

What the book excelled at was giving the entire context of the speech. The line-by-line analysis of the speech only took up a relatively small portion of the book and the rest was devoted to understanding the political and social dynamics of the country at the time. By the time I got to the analysis portion I knew what I needed to know in order to understand it.

Through the analysis of the speech itself I learned how Lincoln used research to build a clear argument and prove his points. It was inspiring to see such clear logic built up step-by-step from historical facts.

### A different time

The last thing I want to say about the book for now is that it is incredible to imagine a time in which an audience could listen to a 90-minute political speech, go absolutely bananas over it, and then demand to hear even more speeches before the night ended. The election of 1860 had 80% voter turnout—shocking by today's standards. It is amazing to read about a time when the written and spoken word were so important and admired.
