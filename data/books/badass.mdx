## Notes

I've returned to Kathy Sierra's _Badass_ over the years because I think it's the best user experience book out there. It puts the focus on helping people grow and becoming better in a specific "compelling context" and doesn't mistake learning a tool for actually becoming good at something you care about. Kathy uses photography as an example throughout the book. People don't want to become experts at using their cameras. They want to become better photographers.

There's a pop quiz in the book that I like. The question is: Which would you rather have a user feel?

1. "This product is awesome!"
2. "This company is awesome!"
3. "This brand is awesome!"

And the answer, of course, is the fourth option. You want them thinking, "_I'm_ awesome!"

The product isn't amazing. What a person can do with the product makes _them_ amazing.
