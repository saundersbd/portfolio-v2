I’ve returned to Kathy Sierra’s _Badass_ over the years because I think it’s the best product book out there. It puts the focus on helping people grow and becoming better in a specific "compelling context" and doesn’t mistake someone learning a tool for actually becoming good at whatever it is they care about.

There’s a pop quiz in the book that I like. The question is: Which would you rather have a user feel?

1. “This product is awesome!”
2. “This company is awesome!”
3. “This brand is awesome!”

The answer is none of the above. You want them thinking, “_I’m_ awesome!”

The product isn’t amazing. What a person can do with the product makes _them_ amazing.
