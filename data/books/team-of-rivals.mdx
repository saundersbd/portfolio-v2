### Summary

I'm always interested in history to the extent that I am able to feel a personal connection to the subject matter. If an author manages to make their subject feel relatable, I enjoy the story more.

_Team of Rivals_ connected me to Abraham Lincoln. I felt by the end of this long book that I understood and appreciated his gifts, and that I knew him as a person. The book is full of examples of Lincoln's leadership, which hold up in today's world. All the examples of his leadership revolved around durable people skills which might be relevant in any time period.

There was a moment in the book where Lincoln offered an officer a military commission, and the officer made it clear to Lincoln that he did not particularly like him or agree with his policies. He said that if Lincoln ever did something he disagreed with, he would resign his commission immediately.

**Lincoln wrote in response:**

> That is frank, that is fair. But I want to add one thing: When you see me doing anything that for the good of the country ought not to be done, come and tell me so, and why you think so, and then perhaps you won’t have any chance to resign your commission.

This response caught the officer off guard because he did not expect a person in Lincoln's position to be willing to sincerely listen to any complaint and be open to changing his views.

### An example of Lincoln revising a speech

Lincoln's Secretary of State, William Henry Seward, suggested the following conclusion for Lincoln's first inaugural address:

> The mystic chords which proceeding from so many battle fields and so many patriot graves pass through all the hearts . . . in this broad continent of ours will yet again harmonize in their ancient music when breathed upon by the guardian angel of the nation.

Lincoln took the words as inspiration for his own conclusion, but he turned them into poetry:

> The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
