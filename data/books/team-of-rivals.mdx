# Team of Rivals

By Doris Kearns Goodwin

<p className="large">
  Team of Rivals is a great book about Abraham Lincoln's life, presidency, and
  leadership. It made Lincoln relatable for me, which is interesting because
  I've since learned that Lincoln was already relatable to modern audiences.

## Summary

I am always interested in history to the extent that I am able to feel a personal connection to the subject matter. If an author manages to make their subjects feel relatable and relevant to my own life, I enjoy the story more.

_Team of Rivals_ did this for me. It was my introduction to Abraham Lincoln and I felt by the end of this long book that I understood and appreciated his unique gifts, and that I knew him as a person. Usually when I read the writing of 19th century figures I find it difficult to understand. People wrote and communicated differently then. But when I read Lincoln his language is so clear and plain that I get it all these years later. He had a gift for communicating complex ideas in simple ways so that they would be accessible by anyone.

The book is full of examples of Lincoln's leadership, which I found surprisingly applicable to leadership today. The reason it's relevant today is that all the illustrations of his leadership revolved around durable people skills. As you watch Lincoln navigating these situations you realized that the way he handles them could apply to any time because although the world is a different place today, people are much the same.

There was a moment in the book where Lincoln offered an officer a military commission, and the officer made it clear to Lincoln that he did not particularly like him or agree with his policies. He said that if Lincoln ever did something he disagreed with, he would resign his commission.

**Lincoln replied:**

> That is frank, that is fair. But I want to add one thing: When you see me doing anything that for the good of the country ought not to be done, come and tell me so, and why you think so, and then perhaps you won’t have any chance to resign your commission.

This response caught the officer off guard because he did not expect a person in Lincoln's position to be willing to sincerely listen to any complaint and be open to changing his views.

I love little moments like that where Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates details from Lincoln's personal correspondence, because it shows his strengths in dealing with others. When you read the big speeches you get a different impression of Lincoln than you do when you read his letters and see how he interacts on a personal level.

## An example of Lincoln revising a speech

Lincoln's Secretary of State, William Henry Seward, suggested the following conclusion for Lincoln's first inaugural address:

> The mystic chords which proceeding from so many battle fields and so many patriot graves pass through all the hearts . . . in this broad continent of ours will yet again harmonize in their ancient music when breathed upon by the guardian angel of the nation.

Lincoln took the words as inspiration for his own conclusion, but look at how he changed the words to make them more beautiful:

> The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.

I love the alliteration in "mystic chords of memory" and "heart and hearthstone." The use of the word hearthstone is poignant because it brings the words into every home. Most importantly, Seward's guardian angel watches over us from above, and Lincoln's "better angels" are inherent in our nature as people.
