# The Path to Power

By Robert Caro

<p className="large">
  I'd heard about how good Caro was for a long time but his work is
  intimidating. At first the subject matter seems dry—how could anyone do five
  books on Lyndon Johnson, and who would want to read that? All I can say is
  that this book set a new standard for me, and every bit of history or
  biography I've read since has paled in comparison.

## Summary

To call this book a biography would be a massive understatement. It's a tome. It's a portrait of not just the early life of one important historical figure, it's a portrait of American life at that particular time. I did not expect that so much of the story would be dedicated not to LBJ himself but to his ancestors and the people he grew up with and the area he grew up in. I felt what it was like to grow up in the impoverished Texas Hill Country. I understand why LBJ was the way he was.

The book taught me things I didn't even know I wanted to know. Caro is not afraid to detour to talk about the history of the Texas Hill Country, or the difficulty of life for the women who lived there ("The Sad Irons" is the best chapter of the book and it has nothing to do with Lyndon Johnson at all). At one point Caro diverges for over 50 pages to talk about Sam Rayburn, a very important figure in the life of Lyndon Johnson. And it was all fascinating.
