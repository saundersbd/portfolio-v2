# Constellation Energy

<p className="large">
  A leadership team at Constellation Energy enlisted our team at Vokal to help
  tell a better story around fruitful partnerships with small businesses. The
  hope was to create concepts that could generate excitement within
  Constellation and lead to further funding. This is one of my favorite kinds of
  projects and even though it happened a long time ago I like to think of it as
  an example of turning business desires into something more human and
  relatableâ€”something I very much enjoy doing.

## Small Business Stories

The image featured below depicts one of the final concepts that resulted from our engagement with Constellation Energy. The business wanted to communicate directly with small business owners about the benefits of going with Constellation for your energy service. I directed the storytelling aspect of the project and devised the concept of doing small business stories. They are case studies that represent a variety of small businesses, told in a highly visual way. The goal of this concept was to create an engaging presentation that would help small business owners envision Constellation as their energy provider.

## Marketing Site Concept

Another idea that came out of this round of work was a new marketing site concept based around the idea that Constellation worries about your energy use so you can focus on running your business. The small business stories are featured on the marketing page.
