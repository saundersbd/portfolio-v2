# VidGrid Video Player

<p className="large">
  In 2020, Paylocity acquired VidGrid, a company that provides video recording
  and publishing solutions to its customers. I was given the opportunity to
  redesign their video player. I created and documented a design system for the
  player and got to use a wide variety of skills during the project, from icon
  design to writing component markup and styles.

## What I did

- Designed the control bar and contextual menus of a video player
- Designed and documented a new design system
- Built a Figma prototype
- Wrote Vue.js components as a means of documenting desired styles and functionality
- Extended an existing icon set by about twenty icons

## Creating a new design system

This video player has additional features such as the ability to search and edit captions. This goes beyond a simple control bar with contextual menus, and justified the creation of a design system to keep everything consistent. I designed and documented the design system and worked with the team to get it built.

It doesn't seem like you would need a massive system to cover the use cases of a video player, but due to the many layers of required functionality the system ended up becoming pretty robust. The component with the most flexibility was the button component, which could take a variety of props and adapt to almost any situation:

/>

## Prototying in Figma

In Figma it was easy to use to create a prototype that showcased the animations and transition effects that would add polish to the experience. The prototype gave all the stakeholders a feel for how the video player would behave without investing time writing code.

## Icon design

I extended an existing icon family to include all the new icons to be used in the video player. The challenge was to make icons that fit the language of the current icon set while looking at home in the video player.

## Documentation

I documented the design system in a quick Notion site, using Figma embeds directly from my documentation for live visuals. The combination of Notion and Figma was powerful because the engineers always had the most up-to-date visuals and I could supplement them with all the document sharing and editing capabilities of Notion.

Each component's page in Notion had an associated Figma file, usage instructions, and formatted code snippets. I wrote the code snippets and CSS because I wanted to be precise with the style definitions and meet the engineering team at a place with which they were familiar.

## Summary

I enjoyed the video player redesign because I got a chance to exercise my flexibility and range. I got in touch with aspects of my skill set that I don't always get to use in the course of my everyday work, such as icon design. I enjoyed doing the detailed vector work required to make the new icons, and I took satisfaction in being able to provide markup and styles for components that could be plugged right into Vue.js components.
