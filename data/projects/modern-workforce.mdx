# Modern Workforce at Paylocity

I am assigned to a team at Paylocity whose goal is to expand what is possible when it comes to collaboration and communication within an HR and payroll platform. Much of this work is under wraps so I will only write very broadly about it.

It all started with our Community product, which I've worked on for nearly three years. Community helps Paylocity customers stay aligned and communicate better at work with features like groups, posts, and announcements. In early 2021, Paylocity acquired a company called Samepage that specialized in software for collaborative document editing. We want Paylocity to become a more collaborative platform where teams can do work together, and most of my work is centered around that goal.

### My work revolves around interesting problems, such as:

- How can we support more collaboration and interaction between coworkers within Paylocity product suite?
- What are the ramifications of introducing collaboration features into a setting where they previously did not exist?
- How do we balance existing transactional interactions and engagement-focused interactions in the same product?
- How can we make employees' lives easier and not more complicated?
- How can we use data to help managers become better at their jobs?
- How can we create a best-in-class mobile experience for employees?

If you are interested in hearing general thoughts about how I've approached each of these problems, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me at [saundersbd@gmail.com](mailto:saundersbd@gmail.com).
