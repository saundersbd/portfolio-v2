# Modern Workforce at Paylocity

I'm currently working on a team at Paylocity that is leading the way when it comes to defining the future of work for an HR and payroll platform.

We are focused on making Paylocity a place where teams can stay aligned and work together while continuing to accomplish all the necessary tasks required of an HR platform.

I am not able to write about the work in great detail, but some of the broad challenges are:

- How can we support more collaboration and interaction between coworkers within the Paylocity product suite?
- What are the ramifications of introducing collaboration features into a setting where they previously did not exist?
- How can we make employees' lives easier?
- How can we use data to help managers get better at their jobs?
- How can we create a best-in-class mobile experience for employees?
