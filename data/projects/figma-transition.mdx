# Managing a Figma Transition

I've used Figma at Paylocity for the last 5 years, despite the fact that our official toolkit has been based around Sketch and Invision. Recently Paylocity decided to make the jump to Figma, and as a passionate and experienced Figma user I've been leading the transition process. We do not have a Design Ops team so it has been a grassroots effort that I'm running in addition to doing my product work. Here's how it's been going and what I've learned so far.

### Initial pilot phase and generating excitement

We started with a small pilot group of designers who were interested in learning more about Figma. The purpose of the pilot group was to generate enthusiasm and assess whether Figma would be a fit for the entire design team going forward. The pilot group presented their experiences and learnings to design leadership and after some time were able to convince them to support a switch to Figma. In the meantime, the pilot group was sharing what they learned and reporting progress to the larger group of designers to help build excitement for the switch.

### Cross-fading Sketch and Figma

I realized pretty quickly that as good as I think Figma is, there is still a learning curve. Since every designer on the team is busy, and everyone learns according to their own pace and style, demanding that people switch to Figma right away did not seem like a wise approach. Therefore, we are looking at a sort of "cross-fade" of Sketch into Figma. We are setting a deadline for when designers need to have their work moved over to Figma, but leaving enough time before the deadline so that the process of learning Figma and moving the files over can happen according to the designer's preferences and availability.

### Providing libraries and shared assets

Because I had been working in Figma for years, I'd already created a component and pattern library for our internal design system and had been maintaining them for some time. This has been crucial for supporting the switch because when designers try Figma for the first time they have all the system components ready to work with. Because they don't need to make anything from scratch, it's easier to see the benefits that Figma has over Sketch. The components are all built natively in Figma (not imported) so they make full use of Figma's auto layout and variants features. Everything was built with ease-of-use for designers in mind. For now I maintain the libraries even though I am not on the systems team. My goal is to turn the keys over to the systems team after they feel comfortable enough with Figma to maintain the system.

### Providing a variety of learning resources

Because everyone learns differently, it has been important to provide a variety of learning resources. This started with a Slack channel where people can ask questions about Figma functionality, and has extended to presentations (created in Figma of course), sharing video clips of functionality, live demos, and one-on-one sessions to help designers figure out how Figma works in specific situations.

### Defining the best practices of working in Figma

This is still a work in progress, but in order to take advantage of Figma's communal nature we are defining best practices and ways to organize our teams and content inside of Figma. This has involved articulating goals for the transition and communicating with the design team to get them on board and following the guidelines. It's not easy because as a team we are still carrying a lot of non-collaborative habits from the Sketch days.
