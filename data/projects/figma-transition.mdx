# Managing a Figma Transition

I have been stubbornly using Figma for over 5 years while the rest of Paylocity's designers used Sketch. Recently we decided to move our team over to Figma and as the most experienced and passionate Figma user I have been asked to lead the transition. We don't have a formal Design Ops team and I quickly discovered that being a go-to person on a design tool switch is a big job. Here's how I've been approaching it so far.

### We're all busy and any change to a designer's workflow will be disruptive

The first reality I had to acknowledge is that even though Figma is clearly the best-in-class design tool and the reasons to switch are self-evident, it's still hard to switch. Even if you back the switch 100%, taking the time to learn a new tool will disrupt your workflow and ability to deliver in the short term.

For this reason, it seemed right to not put any unnecessary pressure on designers to accomplish a switch within an unreasonable timeframe. The first announcement about Figma at Paylocity was, "we got access and are exploring Figma, feel free to grab and account and see experiment with it."

There were a handful of people who jumped in right away and were enthusiastic about the transition. There were also a lot of people who were either too busy to learn something new, or not yet interested. And we were fine with that.

### Building interest

I believed that if people could see what was possible in Figma, and better understand the advantages it has over Sketch, that they would be more inclined to try it out. So I started sharing what was possible by dropping short clips of some of the more impressive functionality in our design slack channel. Auto layout, variants, components, little productivity tricks... I started sharing all these things without asking for any promise to use Figma in return. The goal was to build interest organically and get more people trying out Figma on their own terms.
