# Paylocity

<p className="large">
  The most interesting thing about my 5 years at Paylocity is that I've been
  able to solve a huge variety of problems for many kinds of people, from
  employees all the way to payroll adminstrators. I'm currently working on
  Community, a product that helps teams stay aligned and collaborate.

## Teams & Projects

### Community & Modern Workforce

Community is a software product that Paylocity offers to help teams collaborate and stay aligned. I joined the Community team over two years ago and led design there until the group expanded to include more designers and engineers last November. Now my focus is on the Groups portion of Community, where I am working on building team collaboration features.

### Premium Video

I was the first designer tasked with bringing video recording and sharing features to Paylocity's products. Prior to the acquisition of VidGrid, I did storytelling work around how video could be used throughout our products, and eventually [redesigned the video player](/projects/vidgrid) used within Paylocity and by all VidGrid customers outside of Paylocity.

### HR Team

I designed the first version of the single employee record, which is an aggregated record of employee information available throughout the product. It gathers many disparate employee data points into one place for easy access. I also designed a utility to copy employee data from company to company in the event of an employee transfer to a different location.

### Payroll

I designed a calculator that helps payroll administrators determine how much money an employee should get if that amount needs to be prorated or adjusted retroactively. This was complex because of the need to account for ~30 different pay scenarios in a single calculator interface while keeping it simple.

### Data Insights, Analytics, and Reporting

In 2016 I designed the first version of the retention risk dashboard, a tool that helps HR professionals assess and mitigate turnover at their companies.
