## Teams & Projects

### Community

As the lead designer of Community for the last two years I have worked with the team to deliver several features, such as an tool to draft and manage company announcements, Ask an Expert groups, a video gallery, and a variety of general enhancements to the experience. Nearly all the work we do is cross-platform and therefore we are designing for many different devices and screen sizes.

### Premium Video

I was the first designer dedicated to bringing video recording and sharing features to Paylocity's products. Prior to the acquisition of VidGrid, I did storytelling work around how video could be used throughout our products, and eventually [redesigned the video player](/projects/vidgrid) used within Paylocity and by all VidGrid customers outside of Paylocity.

### HR Team

I designed the first version of the employee record, which is an aggregated record of employee information available throughout the product. It gathers many disparate data points into a single place for easy access. I also worked on a utility to copy employee data from company to company in the event of an employee transfer to a different location.

### Payroll

I designed a calculator that helps payroll admins determine how much money an employee should get if that amount needs to be prorated or adjusted retroactively. The main thing that made this complex was needing to account for about 30 different pay scenarios in a single calculator interface while keeping it simple at the same time.

### Data Insights, Analytics, and Reporting

In 2016 I designed the first version of the retention risk dashboard, a tool that helps HR professionals assess and mitigate turnover at their companies.
