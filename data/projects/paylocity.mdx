# Paylocity

Over my last 6 years at Paylocity I’ve worked on a variety of interesting problems, such as:

- Paylocity’s next gen iOS and Android apps
- A workplace communication and collaboration platform
- A prorated and retro pay calculator for payroll
- A universal employee record
- A retention risk dashboard

## Teams & Projects

### Next gen iOS and Android apps

Currently I’m leading the design for Paylocity’s next generation of mobile apps. As part of this project we are transitioning from one hybrid app to native apps on both iOS and Android. The work involves defining new design systems to support both platforms, and also coming up with a plan for bringing old hybrid experiences into the new native architecture. Additionally, we’re not just copying the old hybrid app, we are looking to provide a totally new and modern experience focused around employee users.

### Community & the modern workforce

I spent 3 years working on a product called Community, which helps company leaders improve communication and productivity within their workforce. In the time I worked on Community our team grew the product from around 20k monthly active users to over 1M MAU.

Some of the Community features that I helped design include:

- An activity feed of posts
- Company announcements
- Groups
- Celebrations
- Live document collaboration

### Premium Video

I was the first designer tasked with bringing video recording and sharing features to Paylocity's products. Prior to Paylocity’s acquisition of VidGrid (a video solutions company), I did storytelling work around how video could be used throughout our products, and eventually [redesigned the video player](/projects/vidgrid) used within Paylocity and by all VidGrid customers outside of Paylocity.

### HR Team

I designed the first version of the single employee record, which is an aggregated record of employee information available throughout the product. It gathers many disparate employee data points into one place for easy access. I also designed a utility to copy employee data from company to company in the event of an employee transfer to a different location.

### Prorated and retro pay calculator

I designed a calculator that helps payroll administrators determine how much money an employee should get if that amount needs to be prorated or adjusted retroactively. This was complex because of the need to account for ~30 different pay scenarios in a single calculator interface while keeping it simple. Today more than 30,000 calculations are performed per month.

### Data Insights, Analytics, and Reporting

In 2016 I designed the first version of the retention risk dashboard, a tool that helps HR professionals assess and mitigate turnover at their companies.
