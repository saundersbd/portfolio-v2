# Paylocity

In over 5 years at Paylocity I've been able to work on a ton of different problems to help all kinds of people, from employees to payroll administrators. I'm currently working on Community, a product that helps teams stay aligned and collaborate.

### Projects I've worked on:

- Workplace communication and collaboration platform
- Payroll prorated and retro pay calculator
- Universal employee record
- Employee copy and transfer tool
- Retention risk dashboard

## Teams & Projects

### Community & Modern Workforce

For the last three years I've worked on a product called Community, which offers our customers a way to improve communication and productivity in the workplace. Right now I'm exploring the collaboration space and thinking about what it means not just to collaborate, but to collaborate in the context of Paylocity's software. We are looking at familiar tools such as collaborative documents through a Paylocity lens.

I am also dedicated to the larger Modern Workforce team, where we are thinking broadly about how to modernize and adapt Paylocity's experience for the next generation entering the workforce. We are focusing on the mobile space and working on delivering a consumer-grade experience for Paylocity customers.

### Premium Video

I was the first designer tasked with bringing video recording and sharing features to Paylocity's products. Prior to the acquisition of VidGrid, I did storytelling work around how video could be used throughout our products, and eventually [redesigned the video player](/projects/vidgrid) used within Paylocity and by all VidGrid customers outside of Paylocity.

### HR Team

I designed the first version of the single employee record, which is an aggregated record of employee information available throughout the product. It gathers many disparate employee data points into one place for easy access. I also designed a utility to copy employee data from company to company in the event of an employee transfer to a different location.

### Prorated and retro pay calculator

I designed a calculator that helps payroll administrators determine how much money an employee should get if that amount needs to be prorated or adjusted retroactively. This was complex because of the need to account for ~30 different pay scenarios in a single calculator interface while keeping it simple. Today more than 30,000 calculations are performed per month.

### Data Insights, Analytics, and Reporting

In 2016 I designed the first version of the retention risk dashboard, a tool that helps HR professionals assess and mitigate turnover at their companies.
