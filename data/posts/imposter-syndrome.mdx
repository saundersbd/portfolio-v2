Our UX team talked about imposter syndrome the other day. The conversation followed what to me feels like a familiar patternâ€”everyone admitted that they struggle with imposter syndrome, and then everyone agreed that we know we shouldn't struggle with it, and then we moved on without talking about how _not_ to struggle with it. I think we tend to avoid solutioning around imposter syndrome because it seems like a fight we can never win, or like we can only wait around and hope to grow out of it. And this makes me wonder: If imposter syndrome is so hard to displace, what might it might look if we stopped trying to do that? How would it look to embrace imposter syndrome and learn to work with it as a partner?

As I continued to think about this, I realized that imposter syndrome is kind of an inseparable part my creative process, and not even necessarily an unwelcome one. Every time I face a difficult problem, or join a new team, or prepare a presentation, I feel like an imposter. I feel terribly small relative to the scale of the problems and the unknowns surrounding them. Even small problems can appear so daunting that I start to feel like I'm not remotely qualified to deal with them. But my process always involves chipping away at the problem slowly, and gaining control over it bit by bit. And the way it always seems to go is that the more I figure out, the less I feel like an imposter. When I look at imposter syndrome from this angle, it's almost like encountering an old friend. And it's like this game we play, me and imposter syndrome, where it shows up to intimidate me and I must conquer it all over again. We meet again, imposter syndrome.

So I think that's one way to work with imposter syndrome instead of passively hoping it will go away. Instead of cowering before it, acknowledge its presence and greet it as an old friend. Solving problems is fun and imposter syndrome is just another problem. But I do think you need to reach a little deeper if you want to equip yourself to accept imposter syndrome as part of your life. You also need to believe on some level that overcoming it is possible.

If you're going to welcome imposter syndrome into your life and start to enjoy the process of working with it, you need to find the light of confidence and past experience that's shining somewhere within you, even if it's just _barely_ shining. Even as your brain is calling you an imposter and telling you that you'll never figure this one out, you need to be seeking out a wiser part of yourself that knows you _can_ figure it out, because you've done so before. You only need to find the smallest amount of faith that you'll be able to handle it, and that faith will be enough to give you the edge. It will allow you to say, "We meet again imposter syndrome, but this time the advantage is mine."

I used to think imposter syndrome would just cease to be a factor in my life. I realize now that I'm going to have to deal with this for as long as I keep challenging myself to grow. The good news is that every time I overcome it, I become better equipped to engage with it in a healthy way next time. Your goal should be to recognize imposter syndrome when you're merged with it, label it for what it is, believe that you'll figure it out, and embrace the process of chipping away at it. When you do this enough you'll start to see imposter syndrome as a familiar foe that has nothing to do with you or your abilities. It might even start to excite you when you recognize it, because its presence signals the beginning of the problem solving process that keeps us all going as designers. More importantly, when imposter syndrome shows up it's a signal that you're continuing to grow.
