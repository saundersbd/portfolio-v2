A lot of times when I am struggling with how to tell a story, I create a presentation for it. I do this regardless of whether I intend to ever give the presentation or not. There's something about the process of breaking my thoughts out into slides that helps me see the story in a different way. It's much easier to spot the gaps where the logic doesn't hang together, and the limited space available on each slide, combined with the scenario of the hypothetical presentation, forces me to be more concise than I might have been in writing.

It's time consuming to create a presentation for every little thing, but I increasingly find that if I've gone to the trouble of thinking through the presentation, I am more prepared than anyone else in the room when the time for the important conversation comes. It took me a long time to realize that people who appear articulate and seem to have an answer for every question aren't just unusually gifted. Most of the time they have done the work required to have those answers ready. They've thought about it more than you have. Creating presentations is just one way I do the work required to have an opinion.

I do think there's value in actually designing the presentation if it somehow helps me clarify my message, but in general, creating a presentation can just mean stubbing it out in markdown with divider lines between each slide. It doesn't have to be a heavy process. The key, however you do it, is to think in steps and adopt the mindset of a presenter with an uninformed audience.

So next time you're struggling with your design work and feel like it's not hanging together conceptually, trying putting together a presentation. It will help you clarify your opinion, and force you to come up with a way to articulate that opinion for an audience. And when the time comes to discuss your work with stakeholders, you'll find that it's easier to talk about your design decisions.
