For a recent project I was asked to propose a solution for enabling users to collaborate within a shared document space (a la Google Docs). As is often the case, the team started talking about the various features we could possibly add. But it's not very productive to think in terms of features. When you think of features you tend to think about them in isolation, almost as objects. This perspective ignores the larger existing system. Instead of focusing on the relationships and ways that information travels _between_ objects, you end up focusing on the objects themselves. And objects only have meaning when placed in a larger context.

When the first thing the team does is start talking about features we can add, I've learned that some work often needs to be done to provide that larger context and get everyone operating out of a more holistic headspace. I try to do this right away, because I know that presenting any design solution will be painful if we're not all thinking about the problem in the same way.

For this document collaboration project I decided to try developing some mental models. Mental models probably has a really precise definition out there somewhere, but for me, I thought of each one as being a sort of maxim or hypothesis that I could point to as justification for my design decisions. To develop the mental models I went into my notes on books and articles I'd previously read, pulled on the relevant threads, and continued to read and take more notes. Eventually some valuable ideas started to crystallize, and I formed them into the following statements, each with about a paragraph of explanation:

- Collaboration is the process of reaching shared understanding
- A collaborative document is a shared mind
- Creating choices is just as valid as making choices
- Collaboration is not a linear process
- A collaborative document is just one part of a much bigger conversation ecosystem

I will not elaborate on these here, but I created a presentation around them and shared what I had learned with stakeholders. I briefly described each mental model, and use illustrations to clarify each one. Then, in the next section of the presentation, I started talking about possible ways to approach the solution space. Every time I proposed a direction to explore, I referenced the applicable mental models.

I had never tried giving a presentation grounded in mental models before and I was pleased with the results. Because I had some foundational ideas to point back to, the audience of stakeholders seemed to better understand my proposals. Even if there was some disagreement about the various solutions, there was no misunderstanding about the intent behind them and what I was trying to accomplish. For example, by setting up a solution with "Collaboration is not a linear process," I was able to talk about how I was designing a collaborative feedback loop as opposed to a user flow. If I had not provided this context I think that the stakeholders might not have understood what I was trying to accomplish.

A challenge with giving a "mental models presentation" is that the audience needs to be a little patient at the beginning while you're planting the seeds for the discussion. When the team is used to jumping right into solutions, spending 10â€“15 minutes talking about theory can be a challenge. The payoff comes later in the presentation, but you should still make sure that you keep your mental models pithy, the presentation interesting, and that you're being really clear about why you're starting things off by not showing high fidelity mocks.

I hope that presenting more of my thinking will lead to thinking being normalized as valid creative output, and increase the odds that solutions I eventually present will be understood and accepted. When designers turn into mockup machines it's bad for our feelings of fulfillment at work, and it creates an unhealthy team dynamic in which the valuable experience of the designer is marginalized over time.
