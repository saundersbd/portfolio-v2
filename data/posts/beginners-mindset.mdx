It is intimidating when you are new to a company or product and feel like you don't know anything about the domain. Years ago at Paylocity I was assigned to the payroll team, and I felt helpless because everyone on the team knew more about payroll than I did. How could I ever know as much as my product owner, who'd been leading the team for several years, or our customers, who were payroll professionals?

For a long time this knowledge gap between my and my peers, and the industry professionals, weighed on me. Then I had a realization that changed everythingâ€”that competing on domain knowledge was a race I couldn't win, at least in the short term, and it was a waste of energy to worry about trying.

I changed the way I was thinking about the situation. I was not hired or placed on the payroll team because I was a payroll expert. I was hired because I am a user experience expert, someone who excels at taking complex ideas and translating them into clear and simple experiences. The only way to design effectively in the short term, and the fastest way to close the knowledge gap, was to embrace a beginner's mindset.

I began to own the fact that I was a complete beginner in payroll. In meetings with my product owner I stopped pretending like I knew more than I really did, and began to freely admit what I _didn't_ know.
This changed everything. Becoming comfortable with my status as a beginner created space for me to ask questions, and my innate designer's curiosity emerged. Rather than hiding my inexpertise, I leaned into it and used it as a platform to ask important design questions. And I translated the answers to those questions into experiences that made sense.

When domain knowledge seems like the most important currency on your product team, it's hard to position yourself as a beginner. I have since learned that becoming comfortable with admitting what you don't know is a core life skill. It can feel uncomfortable at first, but it's ultimately freeing to realize that leaning in to what you don't know is the quickest path to building trust with your team, and acquiring domain knowledge.

In a more general sense, I've also learned that people really value a person who is comfortable responding to a question with, "I don't know the answer, but I can find out." It's easy to tell when someone is dancing around the fact that they don't really know the answer, and nobody expects you to know everything anyway. It's an insecurity thing when you have trouble admitting what you don't know, but it takes so much effort to maintain the facade of knowing everything that being honest about it is the only reasonable path towards growth. Spend your worry budget elsewhere and become comfortable just admitting when you don't know something.
