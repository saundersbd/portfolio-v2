In my experience designing a communication platform at Paylocity I've observed that the way a person perceives their audience affects how they choose engage (or not engage!). If you look at a typical social networking product that is structured around groups of people, the idea that those people communicate differently or not at all depending on who they think is listening seems like a safe hypothesis. If you wrap this dynamic in a workplace context the pressure goes up. When anything you say has the potential to affect your career, you are going to be thinking about several things:

- How big is the audience?
- Who is in the audience and how familiar are you with them?
- Can you predict the audience's reaction to what you say?
- Is there a power imbalance? Do some audience members "outrank" you in the org chart?

These aren't ground-breaking insights, but I continually remind my team that these factors exist and affect how people on our platform choose to show up. Our product is structured around groups, and we have to remember that people will interact differently in each group depending on how comfortable they are with the audience. It especially helps to remember this when we start talking about engagement metrics like how often someone is posting, commenting or reacting. We can't compare someone's average number of posts in a group that the whole company is a part of to how often they post in a small group of their closest collaborators. Engagement will look different depending on the nature of the group, and we have to acknowledge and _be okay with that_.

Once you accept that many people will hesitate to actively engage in unfamiliar groups, and decide to support them in feeling that way, you can start to design in a way that makes interaction with an unfamiliar group feel more comfortable. Maybe you add indicators that show who is in the audience and what their titles are (this could actually be a feature designed to prevent posting!). Or what if you added a tone checker to help people feel sure that they are not adopting a negative tone by mistake? Or, you can stop trying to get people to post in situations where they're uncomfortable and design an interface that encourages less risky passive interactions like adding reactions instead. With the right definition of engagement, a reaction or post view is as valuable as a comment. But the most important thing is recognizing how your users might be feeling and supporting those feelings.

This is a reminder that when you are designing a social system, you need to think about how people communicate. If your goal is to drive up the number of interactions at all costs, but in doing so you trick people into contributing in ways that hurt their careers, or that make them uncomfortable, it will do long-term damage. By acting to help people understand the social context better you can increase their comfort and trust in your product, and will likely see stronger engagement as a result. It might just show up in different ways than you expect, or be unevenly distributed throughout the product.
