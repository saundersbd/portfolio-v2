In my experience designing a communication platform at Paylocity I've observed that the way a person perceives their audience affects how they choose engage (or not engage!). If you look at a typical social networking product that is structured around groups of people, the idea that those people communicate differently or not at all depending on who they think is listening seems like a safe hypothesis. If you wrap this dynamic in a workplace context the pressure goes up. When anything you say has the potential to affect your career, you are going to be thinking about several things:

- How big is the audience?
- Who is in the audience and how familiar are you with them?
- Can you predict the audience's reaction to what you say?
- Is there a power imbalance? Do some audience members "outrank" you in the org chart?

These aren't ground-breaking insights, but as a designer of a workplace communication platform, I continually remind the team that these factors exist and affect how people on our platform choose to show up. Our product is structured around groups, and we have to remember that people will interact differently in each group depending on how comfortable they are with the audience. It especially helps to remember this when we start talking about engagement metrics like how often someone is posting, commenting or reacting. We can't compare the average number of employee posts in a group that the whole company is a part of to their posts in a small group with their closest collaborators. Utilization and engagement will look different depending on the nature of the group, and we have to acknowledge and _be okay with that_.

Once you accept that many people will hesitate to engage in larger, more unfamiliar groups, and decide to support that they feel this way, you can start to design in a way that helps them feel more comfortable with that dynamic. Maybe you add indicators that show who is in the audience and what their titles are (this could actually be a feature designed to prevent posting!). Or what if you added a tone checker to help people feel sure that they are not adopting a negative tone by mistake? Or, you can stop fighting the battle of getting people to post in situations where they're uncomfortable and design a UI that encourages "safer" interactions like reacting instead. Accept views as a form of engagement that is as valuable in this context as posting.

This is a reminder that when you are designing a social system, you need to think about how people communicate. If your goal is to drive up the number of interactions at all costs, but in doing so you trick people into contributing in ways that hurt their careers, or that make them uncomfortable, it will do long-term damage. By acting to help people understand the social context better you can increase their comfort and trust in your product, and will likely see stronger engagement as a result. It might just show up in different ways than you expect, or be unevenly distributed throughout the product.
