It's rare to hear someone talk about mentorship in the negative. Any level of mentorship seems like it has to be a good thing right? In my experience that's not always the case. I've identified some mentorship mistakes and misconceptions that, when adopted, can do more harm than good to the unsuspecting mentee.

### Mistake #1: Declaring yourself someone's mentor

You don't get to declare yourself a mentor. You can try, but wishing it doesn't make it so. Ultimately it's the other person who decides whether they see you that way. Being thought of as a mentor is a sign of deep trust and appreciation in a relationship, and it's earned over time. Starting by thinking of yourself as a mentor first is a sign that you're into the idea of mentorship more than the substance. Begin with a genuine interest in the other person, and the honor of being thought of as a mentor will emerge over time.

### Mistake #2: Valuing the employee over the person

Mentorship starts with valuing the entire person, not just the employee. If it starts with anything but a deep interest in learning more about who the other person is and what they value, it will not reach its full potential. When I look at the best mentors that I've had in my life, the consistent theme is that they've taken an interest in who I am outside of work. At times they've given me advice that runs contrary to their own self-interest because they knew it was what I needed to grow. If mentorship stops at the edges of the work context you will never access the level of trust and openness that helps it reach its best form.

### Mistake #3: Thinking only about your career advancement

If the main reason you're interested in mentorship is because it's what _you_ need to do to take the next step in your career, the relationship will not be very impactful. It's possible to recognize that you need to be more of a mentor to take that next step, and take steps to become one, but if it's all about your own advancement that will be exceedingly apparent to the people who hope to mentor, and prevent the kind of deep trust that is needed to play a pivotal role in someone's life.

### Mistake #4: Thinking mentorship is all verbal

It's easy to think that mentorship only occurs over coffee or one-on-ones, and that what you say in those meetings makes up the majority of the value. That's the wrong way to think about it. In reality, a person will learn much more from the way you carry yourself every day than what you can possibly relate in a 30-minute conversation. The way you handle your own life and your relationships with others is far more meaningful and inspiring than anything you can say over coffee, and it's those things that make the deepest impression.

### Mistake #5: Thinking it's a one-way street

Mentorship is not a transfer of useful information from a person who has it to someone who doesn't; it's a two-way teaching relationship. If you're so set in your ways and confident in your wisdom that you assume your mentee has nothing to teach you, you will not seem very open or approachable to them. They'll trust you less, and be less willing to try their strengths and experiment. As a result, they'll learn less. If you're not willing to say "you might be right" or "I never thought about it that way before," working with you will become very disheartening over time as people learn that they can never be right where you're concerned. Eventually they'll stop trying.
