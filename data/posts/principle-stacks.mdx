# Principle Stacks

<PageNote
  description={`In Episode 177 of the Exponent podcast, Ben Thompson and James Allworth touched on the idea of a "principle stack". I wanted to think about the concept and expand on it a little more.`}

We've all been part of efforts to articulate principles that we should try to honor through our personal behavior, interactions with one another, and the way we design our products and services. But there is an aspect of every organization's principles which is rarely discussed, which is that there is an awkward reality about adopting and working with any set of principles on a moment-by-moment basis.

The awkward reality of working with principles is that **you're never going to have just one principle, and your principles will sometimes conflict with one another**.

To abide by one principle often means that you cannot fully abide by another. When your stated principles conflict, how should behave? You have to make decisions about which principle wins over the other. When you sacrifice certain principles over and over again they start to mean less over time. This is where the principle stack comes in.

A principle stack is not just a list of principles. It's a _ranked_ list of principles. In a situation where you are trying to follow two or more principles that are in conflict, you can refer to the principle stack to remind yourself which principle outranks the others, and go with that one.

In some ways the principle stack seems like an overly simplistic concept that would fall apart the second you try to implement it. So I have a problem I'm trying to solve where Principle #2 and Principle #3 are in conflict, and all I have to do is follow the list and let Principle #2 win? What if Principle #3 is somehow truer or more relevant to this situation than #2? Do I have to follow #2 anyway? Context matters!

Yes, context matters. Which is why I'm proposing that a principle stack is not valuable when adopted as a law, but instead when viewed as a tool for making decisions. The true value of a principle stack is that it makes it easier to view your principles for what they really areâ€”a system of linked beliefs.

A principle stack exposes the relationships between your principles and allows you to have meaningful discussions when they come into conflict. If there's a conflict and you are thinking about aligning to Principle #3 instead of Principle #2, the fact that they are ranked forces you to grapple with some heavy questions.

Are your principles ranked correctly? Sometimes there is a difference between how you believe your principles are ranked, and how they rank according to your behavior. If you find yourself choosing Principle #3 over Principle #2 again and again, it might be a sign that there is a disjoint between what you say you value and what you value in practice. The stack allows you to spot this pattern, talk about it, and make an adjustment if necessary.

What do you sacrifice by choosing to follow Principle #3 instead of Principle #2, and are those sacrifices acceptable? Through the process of comparing ranked principles the things that you will have to give up become clearer. Every tough decision is defined its trade-offs, and the principle stack makes it easier to articulate those trade-offs and come to an informed decision.

So, at the very least forming a principal stack is an interesting exercise. It forces you to think more critically about what you value, and helps you understand how your principals relate when they come into conflict with one another. It helps your principals become more than words on a page.
