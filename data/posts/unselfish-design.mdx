In reflecting upon how I've approached design and work throughout my career, and as I consider what I want to do and be in the future, I've noticed an interesting shift in mindset from where I was at even 3-4 years ago. What's the shift? I think it's all about being less self-centered, and more invested in the success of the people around me, and whatever we're building together.

In my earlier working years, I was often selfish. It's a little hard to admit, but I was very much concerned with my own work and opportunities. At times I felt like I deserved things that I probably didn't deserve, and I didn't always feel gratified at the success of my coworkers. Kind of a tough look!

But what I've come to learn is that one of the greatest joys of being one designer on a team of designers is realizing that the work truly is not just about you. And I don't mean knowing it in theory, because it's a fairly easy thing to agree withâ€”I mean truly living it every day at work, and embodying what it means to be a great teammate and leader.

## Thinking about "the work" differently

I still love being an individual contributor and doing "the work." I've been pleasantly surprised, however, to find that there are some other things that I love doing just as much as the work, if not moreso. I'm not exaggerating when I say that realizing I even have the capacity for these things has changed who I am not just as a designer, but as a person. It has changed my internal story about who I am, what I value, and what I'm capable of.

## "The work" now includes:

### Creating opportunities for my teammates to do their best work and grow in their careers

I never used to recognize opportunities at work where I might be able to jump in and effect change. Later on, I had enough experience to recognize the opportunities, but I tried to step into all of them myself. Now I'm able to see more gaps than ever, but instead of trying to fill them all myself I think about who on my team is a good fit for the opportunity, let them know that it exists, and encourage them to step into it if it's something they want. And then I set them up to be successful and visible with that opportunity.

### Surfacing good work to busy leaders and managers

I've been at my company for a while now, and I have relationships with managers and other leaders that not every designer has. When I see a newer designer doing good work, I let their manager and people higher up the chain know about it, because it's all too easy for them to miss the important little things that happen every day. Newer designers haven't always learned that they need to be their own advocates and I want to reduce the amount of invisible work that happens.

### Helping teammates find their voices and build key relationships

In meetings I try to create space for everyone to contribute to the conversation. I notice when someone is trying get a word in on Zoom and have gotten better at interjecting to help create that opportunity for them. I try to understand how people would be comfortable contributing and help them get involved in the conversation on their terms.

## Wrapping up

I think that if you're a designer looking to take the next step in your career, you should consider whether you need to expand your definition of career success to include elevating others in addition to yourself. It's not necessarily an intuitive behavior change to give what seems like a fantastic opportunity to someone else, but when you consistently elevate the people around you, you will inevitably become more of a leader at the same time. And you might find that it changes your understanding of what it means to be a good designer!
